The files here are my solutions for the assignments given in the Coursera course Algorithms Part 1.

The assignments are very challenging and graded strictly (time and memory usage of the codes submitted).

My overall score was 86%.

Assignments:
1. **Percolation**: In a (n x n) square matrix (initially all the blocks considered as closed), the challenge was to find out at which 
percentage of blocks open (while opening the blocks one by one randomly) the system percolates (from top to bottom). This had to be 
done with time and memory constraints.

2. **Stacks and Queues**: Implement a stack where objects can be put in, but while retrieving them, they come out randomly. There 
were time and memory constraints.

3. **Priority Queues**: Use Priority Queue data structure to find all the sets of 4 points located in a straight line efficiently.

4. **8 Puzzle**: Solve the game of 8 Puzzle in the shortest possible moves, find out if the board given is solvable or not.

5. **Find Nearest Point**: Given a point in a 2 dimensional space with many other points, the challenge was to find the 
nearest point in an efficient way and comparing with the brute force algorithm.
